summary: The construction of the Cornubian Batholith
weight: 40
---
The latest Carboniferous marked the onset of bimodal magmatism in SW
England characterised by ultramafic lamprophyre dykes and, slightly
later, a Permian felsic granite batholith with associated
quartz-porphyry dykes. The earliest lamprophyric rocks are intruded
during the Stephanian into D3 extensional structures (Alexander and
Shail, 1996). Later, Permian granite magmatism emplaced the Cornubian
Batholith, exposed at surface as a suite of plutons, into the
Devonian-Carboniferous sedimentary succession. The Cornubian Batholith
comprises granites and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes (locally referred
to as "elvans") which are illustrated in
Figure 1.

The surface crop of the granite plutons have been studied extensively.
Poor outcrop exposure and various mapping techniques have led to
contrasting interpretations of these plutons. In this section, the most
up-to-date mapping and interpretation by Simons et al. (2016, 2017) is
presented as the state-of-the-art. The work by Simons et al. (2016)
presents a revised geological classification of the granite plutons
based on previous mapping which has been augmented through new
geochemical, mineral and field evidence. Further work by Simons et al.
(2017) helps elucidate magma fractionation and the relationships between
different granite classes identified in Simons et al. (2016).

### Lamprophyres

Ultramafic lamprophyre intrusions ranging from olivine-basalt, minette
(K-feldspar \> plagioclase) to biotitic-microsyenite compositions occur
across the SW peninsula (Edmonds et al., 1968; Edwards, 1999; Leveridge
et al., 1990, 2002; McKeown et al., 1973). The "Exeter Volcanic Rocks"
is a term used to describe significant occurrences of lamprophyric and
basaltic dykes, sills and lava flows associated with extensional
structures west of Exeter (Edwards, 1999). Lamprophyric dykes are
notable further west such as the Pendennis, Mawnan, Treliske, Mountjoy
and Furzehill Bridge lamprophyres, however, extrusive rocks are not
found in these areas (Leveridge et al., 1990, 2002; Reid and Scrivenor,
1906), most likely because of erosion. The mafic melt is considered to
have a mantle source with only minor crustal contamination or mixing
with contemporaneous felsic melt (Leat et al., 1987; Simons et al.,
2017). It is however, postulated that minette compositions may be
achieved from lamproite magmas mixing with \>30% felsic crustal melt
(Prelević et al., 2004). Geochronological data for lamprophyric
intrusive and extrusive bodies are summarised in
Table 1.

The geochronology data are latest Carboniferous to Early Permian age and
indicates that mafic magmatism was coeval with granite magmatism and
intrusion of the main batholith (see
Table 2; Chesley et al.,
1993; Chen et al., 1993; Dupuis et al., 2015). Spatially, lamprophyres
do not occur over or within the batholith and a "shadow zone" exists
suggesting lower crustal melting may have precluded the assent of mafic
magma and resulted in hybridisation of the two melt components as part
of the batholith (Shail et al., 2014). However, this does not preclude
known lamprophyres to be altered by later mineralisation events (e.g.
Holywell Bay; Dupuis et al., 2015).

### Granite Magmatism

Granite plutons characterise many of the topographic highs across
Cornwall and Devon such as Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor. These plutons were
intruded into the Devonian-Carboniferous sedimentary succession during
erosion, extension and exhumation of the Variscan orogen (Shail and
Leveridge, 2009). The region has 6 major plutons, Land's End,
Tregonning-Godolphin, Carnmenellis, St Austell, Bodmin and Dartmoor with
numerous smaller exposures, and occur in an approximately ENE-WSW trend,
offset by NW-SE dextral strike-slip faults (Leveridge et al., 2002;
Scrivener, 2006). These plutons are generally poorly exposed, with most
outcrops forming weathered hilltops (tors) or are exposed in quarries.
Limited exposure exists from underground mine workings whilst the Land's
End Granite, and a short section of the Tregonning-Godolphin Granite,
are the only plutons with coastal outcrops which provide high-quality
exposure. Much of the unexposed inland areas are mapped from field brash
or "float" which is not in-situ. Simons et al. (2016) classified the
plutons into 5 granite classes (G1-G5) and mapped the spatial
distribution of these, and various subclasses over the region;
illustrated in Figure 2.

types (G1-G5), with subtypes, for the whole granite batholith.
 </figcaption>
</figure>

The interpretations by Simons et al. (2016) are based on whole-rock
geochemical analyses and mineralogical data supported by geochronology
and field-evidence where permissible. It should be noted that the
whole-rock geochemistry and mineralogy is only collected from areas of
outcrop and thus is limited to exposed areas. Therefore, whilst a robust
classification can be made for known outcrops, much of the spatial
distribution is inferred and harmonised with previous mapping.

The classification reconciled many other previous works that often
focussed on a single pluton such as that of Booth and Exley (1987), Knox
and Jackson (1990), Manning et al. (1996), Exley (1996) and Powell
(2004). The major revisions made by Simons et al. (2016) were the
classification of two-mica (G1) and muscovite (G2) granites and the
grouping of Li-mica and tourmaline granite types into a single
tourmaline (G4) class. The G4 class is contrary to the work by Manning
et al. (1996) who considered Li-mica and tourmaline granites as
geochemically distinct. The work also reflected the separation of two
major magmatic stages that intruded G1 and G2 before G3 to G5;
geochronology to support this is presented in
Table 2. The timing of
these magmatic events is supported and developed further by Tapster
(2019, *in preparation*) and linked to the timing of lamprophyre intrusion.

The work by Simons et al. (2016) provides an excellent foundation for
comparing granitic rocks from across the batholith. It provides an
insight into the internal variations of plutons, but also demonstrates
the intra-class variability, primarily based on mineralogical analyses,
within each defined class. The classification provides a contemporary,
regionally consistent and up-to-date framework for granite
classification.

### Granite at Depth

The interpretations by (Simons et al., 2016) of the outcrop of the
granite are considered robust, however, there is a significant
assumption that the surface exposure of the granite batholith is
representative of what lies at depth. Whilst the classification of
different granite types within the batholith remains a difficult problem
to resolve, some estimates can be placed on the shape and volume of the
granite mass through geophysical interpretation.

Bott et al. (1958) demonstrated through gravity modelling that the
granite plutons were linked in the subsurface and more extensive
modelling showed that the batholith is approximately tabular
(Willis-Richards and Jackson, 1989). Gravity modelling has been applied
in various guises to define the extent of the granite at depth (Beer et
al., 1975; Rollin, 1988; Rollin et al., 1982; Tombs, 1980, 1977),
however, the modelling of the granite surface by Willis-Richards and
Jackson (1989) provided a regional model for the upper surface of the
granite, shown in
Figure 3. There
have been few occasions where boreholes have been drilled to validate
these various models of the granite surface at depth, however, previous
holes drilled based on smaller predictions include the intersection of a
granite body at Bosworgey \[SW 58060 33670\] approximately 173 m
(prediction; 350 m) and the failed intersection at Parbola \[SW 61570
36370\] where the hole stopped at 665.5 m following a predicted
intersection at 540 m (Burley et al., 1978). When compared to depths in
the regional surface model generated by Willis-Richards and Jackson
(1989), these values indicate deeper values of 545 m and 530 m for
Bosworgey and Parbola, respectively, and that they lie proximal to a
sharp edge to the batholith. Therefore, it can be considered that
current gravity modelling, either regional or locally, is insufficient.
To-date, no new gravity measurements have been acquired and significant
scope remains for a high-resolution gravity survey to elucidate the
granite surface a depth which remains a target for mineral exploration
and geothermal energy potential.

Despite the model by Willis-Richards and Jackson (1989) targeting the
upper surface of the granite, with little constraint on deeper
structure, a volume for the batholith was calculated and estimated to be
of the order of 68,000 km^3^ with a thickness of 8 to 22 km.

 <i>Figure 3</i> Granite surface model based on regional gravity modelling by
Willis-Richards and Jackson (1989). The model demonstrates the linking
of plutons at depth, however, likely overestimates the depth extent of
the granite when compared with forward gravity modelling by Taylor
(2007).

More recent gravity modelling by Taylor (2007) confirm the tabular
nature of the granite batholith but infer that the tabular emplacement
model is likely to be more complicated. Furthermore, the thickness of
granite plutons is revised significantly to approximately 5 to 8 km with
the exception of Dartmoor at 8 to 10 km. Moreover, Shail et al. (2014)
compared seismic reflection data from SWAT5 and SWAT6 (Scheirer and
Hobbs, 1990) and seismic refraction data by Brooks et al. (1984) with
gravity modelling of Edwards (1984) to underline that geophysical data
most likely suggests a thickness to the batholith of \<10 km which would
result in a drastically reduced overall volume. Again, acquisition of
new, high-resolution gravity measurements would enhance these
interpretations.
