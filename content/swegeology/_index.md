I have included some pages below about the geology of SW England and its mineraliation. These pages represent the literature review I compiled during my PhD studies. My full thesis can be downloaded from the University of Exeter's online repository [Open Research Exeter](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/37504).
